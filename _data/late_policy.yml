policies:
  - Homework will be due at the beginning of lectures unless stated otherwise. Homework not turned before class on the day it is due will lose 20%. Each additional day loses another 20%. The lowest homework and quiz grade will be dropped. Please note homework performance will count as 40% of your final grade. While students in class are encouraged to discuss the assigned problems, each student should write and submit their own solution and should not copy the solutions of other students. This policy will be strictly enforced in this class. If you have any question about whether some activity would constitute cheating, please feel free to ask. 
  - In-class (or virtual) quizzes will account for 35% of your final grade. The quiz will be individual and closed book. Formula, and other relevant material will be provided to students if necessary. The time of the quiz will be communicated to students at least one week before. No makeup quiz.
  - The class will have one exam that will account for 20% of your grade. The exam will include everything covered in the class. Further details will be provided days before the exam. No makeup exam.
  - Every student is expected to attend every class for the whole class duration. Attendance will be checked randomly, and three unexplained absence will result in 0 point in the attendance score. If you need to miss a lecture because of a medical emergency or something equally significant, please inform the instructor before the start of the class.
